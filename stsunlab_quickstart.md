## Overview
The `ST SUNLAB Quickstart` template provides a starting point for connecting ST SUNLAB IoT devices that communicate via
UDP using an ASCII delimited protocol.

This template uses one of the available shared UDP ports that enables rapid testing.

## Import Parameters
- **UDP Port**: By default, port 9130 is used for ST SUNLAB devices, but you can use any port that is assigned to your account.

## UDP Service
The UDP service must be defined with a custom formatter that uses the `stsunlab` type, this allows the UDP server to extract
the device identifiers from the payloads.

## Triggers

### UDP - Decode delimited data
This trigger is used to decode the ASCII delimited payload, convert it to a javascript object, and publish a generic event
that can be further processed and forwarded to other triggers or enterprise applications.

## Next Steps
After importing this template, you will have one endpoint defined, and you can test sending traffic.

### Sending sample traffic
Using linux, you can use the tool `nc` to send traffic to the UDP port.  Ensure you substitute `<key>` with the unique 
key generated by the template.
```
echo "pub,<key>,23.5,49.2" | nc -u udp-us.tartabit.com 9000
```
