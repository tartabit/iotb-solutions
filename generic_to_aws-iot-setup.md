## Overview
The `AWS IoT Core Setup` template is a special template that invokes an AWS Cloud Formation script to provision your AWS IoT Core 
with a basic level of configuration to enable IoT Bridge to register and connect devices.

This template must be run to initialize your AWS IoT Core account before you can use the IoT Bridge.  If you are an expert user of AWS IoT Core,
you can perform the steps yourself, you just need to have the MQTT URL and a CA certificate/key pair to load into the IoT Bridge.
